# Wound Analysis Using Arduino Sensors

**Authors:** Aman and Alfee

## Project Overview

This project, "Wound Analysis Using Arduino Sensors," was developed as part of our final year project in college. The primary objective of the project is to predict wound health using sensor data and the ID3-based decision tree algorithm. The system provides a reliable and efficient way to monitor and assess the condition of wounds.

## Features

- **Sensor Integration:** Utilized multiple sensors connected to an Arduino Uno to collect wound data.
- **Prediction Algorithm:** Implemented the ID3 Decision Tree algorithm to predict the health of wounds based on the collected data.
- **Data Storage:** Stored the sensed data in CSV files for analysis and record-keeping.
- **Sketch Coding:** Used Sketch for writing and uploading the code to the Arduino Uno, ensuring efficient data collection and processing.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Various Sensors** (specify the types of sensors used, e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.)
- **Computer with Arduino IDE installed**

## Installation and Setup

1. **Assemble the Hardware:**
   - Connect the sensors to the Arduino Uno board as per the project requirements.
   
2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE (Sketch).
   - Write or upload the provided code to the Arduino Uno.

3. **Run the System:**
   - Ensure all connections are secure and power up the Arduino Uno.
   - The system will start collecting wound data and storing it in CSV files.
   - The ID3 Decision Tree algorithm will process the data to predict wound health.

## Usage

1. **Connect the Sensors:** Ensure that all sensors are properly connected to the Arduino Uno.
2. **Upload the Code:** Upload the Sketch code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Collect Data:** The sensors will start collecting data which will be processed by the Arduino.
4. **Analyze Data:** The ID3 Decision Tree algorithm will predict the wound health based on the collected data.

## Project Structure

- **/code:** Contains the Arduino Sketch code.
- **/data:** Directory for storing collected data in CSV format.

## Future Work

- Improve the prediction accuracy by incorporating more advanced algorithms.
- Expand the sensor array to gather additional relevant data.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using Arduino sensors and machine learning algorithms to monitor and assess wound health. We hope this project will serve as a foundation for further research and development in the field of health monitoring.
